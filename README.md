# LittleEngine 3D

This is essentially a v2 of [`LittleEngine`](https://github.com/karnkaul/LittleEngine) (which is a 2D, SFML based engine), being developed in OpenGL 3.3 (and 3.0 ES).

### How to Build
* VS2019/Ninja: 
	1. Open root directory in Visual Studio 2019
	1. Select Build > Build All
	1. Run le3d-test (or custom executable target)
* Others:
	1. Run CMake
	1. Select root directory as source
	1. Select an output directory (`out/...` is ignored)
	1. Click Configure and pick your build environment; ensure no errors are thrown
	1. Click Generate
	1. Open project and build
	1. Run le3d-test (or custom executable target)

### Shader Vertex Attributes
The engine expects vertex shaders to use a specific layout when using `gfx::genVertices()`:
- 0 => `vec3 aPos` [required]
- 1 => `vec3 aNormal`
- 2 => `vec2 aTexCoord`

It is recommended to use UBOs for light data and view/projection matrices instead of individual uniforms. Use `resources::addUBO()` to auto-bind them to subsequent shaders created via `resources::loadShader()`, and `gfx::setUBO<T>()` to copy data (must be 16-aligned).

### MVP Target
- [x] Perspective and orthographic projections
- [x] 2D view and quad drawing
- [x] Model loading
- [x] Text rendering
- [x] Debug primitives (cube, sphere, cone, etc)
- [ ] Particle systems (using instancing)
- [ ] Shadows (directional lights)
- [ ] ImgUI integration
- [ ] Trivial collision system
